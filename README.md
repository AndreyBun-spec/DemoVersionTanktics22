This project was implemented on Unity 2020 C#. The game has 2 teams of units: blue and red. Each team has a blue and red flag respectively. The user controls a red unit that plays as a team of pink units. The task of each team is to get to the flag of the opposing team and hit it with a shot. At the same time, on the way to the opponent's flag, you need to defend yourself from enemy units and shoot at them. When any unit is destroyed, it reappears at the certain place. The game also provides a map editor, where the user can create and save their location. In this location, the user himself makes the arrangement on the map: the places where enemy and friendly units appear, the places where the blue and red flags are placed. There is a check for possible user errors. If the user forgets to set a flag, set units, or tries to save the map with an empty name, the program will display an error message. The editor provides the ability to edit, delete and create new locations.
